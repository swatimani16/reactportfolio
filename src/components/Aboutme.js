                  I live in Irving, Texas, USA, originally from India. Developing something that can be visualised, amuses me, so is Web application development. Like there is rhythm in dance I like to have rhythm in my life.
                  Professionally, I am looking for exciting opportunities in Web Development using Python and its frameworks like Django, Django REST framework and Software Development, where I can best utilize my skills and strengths to accomplish the organizationâ€™s goals and objectives and at the same time get an opportunity to expand my knowledge base.
                  Apart from my educational projects, I have worked on developing Python based Web applications like Covid tracker web app, Blog web application as well as a Full-stack web application using Angular 10 as the front-end and Django REST API to design the API to fetch data from the backend. You can view these deployed projects in the project section of this website.
                  I have working knowledge of deploying a Flask web application on AWS EC2 and performing autoscaling based upon the variation in the traffic entering the website.
                  I am looking forward to working on exciting and challenging projects where I can enhance my knowledge as well as contribute in the team and company I will be working with.
